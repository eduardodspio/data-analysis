# Demographic Data Analyzer

In the FreeCodeCamp Demographic Data Analyzer project, I conducted an examination of a supplied dataset comprising demographic data. This project aimed to demonstrate my data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and visualization abilities. The following are the essential steps I followed to complete this project:

Data Loading: I imported the dataset into my programming environment using tools like pandas in Python, which allowed me to efficiently access and work with the data.

Data Exploration and Analysis: I thoroughly explored the dataset, generating basic statistics for variables such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

Answering Key Questions: I handled specific FreeCodeCamp challenges, such as finding the most common occupation, calculating the percentage of people with a certain education level, or analyzing the link between race and gender inside the dataset.
