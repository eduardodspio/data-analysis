# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

In this project, the calculator takes as input a list of integers and performs the following calculations:

Mean: It computes the mean of the numbers, which is the average value derived by adding all of the numbers and dividing by the total number of counts.

Variance: It computes the variance of the numbers, which quantifies the dataset's spread or dispersion. The average of the squared deviations between each number and the mean is the variance.

Standard Deviation: It computes the standard deviation of the numbers, which is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation measures how much the statistics differ from the mean.
